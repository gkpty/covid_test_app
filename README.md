## Why a platform
**It helps gather the correct data** -> which can then be analyzed with advanced algorithms to make better predictions.
**Streamlines the process for patients** -> By allowing them to request a test from your home with a mobile phone.
**Streamlines processes for local governments** -> Register tests and keep track. Keep track of which patient received which test if they follow up with symptoms or request a second test.
**Keeps other citizens informed realtime** -> realtime heatmap visualization of areas with covid and stats in a public site. Realtime reports for media
